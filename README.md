## Strava Social

This was a hobby project developed for the Strava Apps competition. It got in the top 25 and gained me a subscription to Premium for a few years :).

The app took follower data and created a responsive map of the social network showing links between various followers. It also visualised the locations of your followers on a global map. D3js Force Directed Graphs and Mapping were used.
